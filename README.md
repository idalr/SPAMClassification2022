# SPAMClassificationSoSe22

This repository was part of the CogSys Master's compulsory module (BM2: Intelligente Datenanalyse & Maschinelles Lernen I), which I took in the Summer Semester 2022 at the University of Potsdam, Germany.

## Project description

The goal of this project is to build an algorithm that classify emails into spam and non-spam while no more than 0.02% of non-spam emails is classified as spam. The problem must be approached with machine learning methods discussed in the course.
